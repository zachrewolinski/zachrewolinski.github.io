::: {#hero-heading}

I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley, advised by [Bin Yu](https://binyu.stat.berkeley.edu/).

My research is primarily focused on ensuring that machine learning models are trustworthy of making real-world decisions in high-impact fields such as finance, medicine, criminal justice, and more. My research is supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I graduated from Rice University in 2023 with a B.S. in Statistics, a B.S. in Computer Science, and a B.A. in Mathematics. While at Rice, I was fortunate to work with [Genevera Allen](https://genevera-allen.com/).
