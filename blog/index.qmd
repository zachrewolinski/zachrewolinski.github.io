  Mostly a place for me to collect my thoughts, and send them out into the void.
# listing:
#   contents: blog
#   sort: "date desc"
#   type: default
#   categories: false
#   sort-ui: false
#   filter-ui: false
# if blog is updated and doesn't work, it could be the fact that i removed
# the _freeze/blog code from the root directory. just a hint for where to
# potentially look, since i'm not certain what that does.

My blog is over on [Substack](https://zachrewolinski.substack.com/), which might be a little bit overkill for what I intend for it to be. Thus far most of my blog ideas are related to education policy, but I will likely branch into more AI-centered topics relevant to my PhD as time goes on.
