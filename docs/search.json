Rewolinski\n  \n  \n    \n     Zachary Rewolinski\n  \n\n  \n  \nI am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley, advised by Bin Yu.\nMy research is primarily focused on ensuring that machine learning models are trustworthy of making real-world decisions in high-impact fields such as finance, medicine, criminal justice, and more. My research is supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.\nI graduated from Rice University in 2023 with a B.S. in Statistics, a B.S. in Computer Science, and a B.A. in Mathematics. While at Rice, I was fortunate to work with Genevera Allen."
