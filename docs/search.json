My research is supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.\nI am also an Associate (part-time) Analyst with the San Diego Padres Research & Development team.\nI graduated from Rice University in 2023 with a B.S. in Statistics, a B.S. in Computer Science, and a B.A. in Mathematics. While at Rice, I was fortunate to work with Genevera Allen.\n\n\n\n\nRecent News\n\nNovember 2025: I have returned to the San Diego Padres R&D team as an Associate Analyst.\nOctober 2025: Our paper PCS Workflow for Veridical Data Science in the Age of AI has been accepted to Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A!\nJune 2025: A preprint for our paper PCS Workflow for Veridical Data Science in the Age of AI is available.\nJune 2025: A preprint for our paper Local MDI+: Local Feature Importances for Tree-Based Models is available.\nJune 2025: I started my internship with the San Diego Padres Research & Development team."
